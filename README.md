# SwiftUtils

This Library contains some Swift tools that I create in daily life.
## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Once you have your Swift Package set up, you add this code to your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/LoniQin/swift-utils", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

In Xcode, you can choose File->Swift Packages->Add Pakcage dependancies, and add https://github.com/LoniQin/swift-utils.
